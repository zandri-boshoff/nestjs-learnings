## What is NestJS?

NestJS is a NodeJS framework that is used on the backend (server-side).  
NestJS builds on ExpressJS (which is also a NodeJS framework).  
Thus, NestJS is a framework built on-top of a framework.

## Why NestJS?

NestJS adds new ideas to the NodeJS framework. For example:

- it embraces TypeScript
- dependency injection
- modularity
  Any server-side application can be built using NestJS. For example:
- MVC apps
- REST API's
- GraphQL API's  
  NestJS makes building complex applications easy as it:
- Enforces clean code
- Enforces certain patterns

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn run start:prod

```
